> 📋 Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> 📋 Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python main.py --train 1
```

> 📋 Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python main.py --train 0
```

> 📋 Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://comingsoon..) trained on CIFAR using parameters x,y,z.

> 📋 Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Replication of sample data](https://comingsoon..)

| Model name       | Top 1 Accuracy | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model | 85%            | 95%            |

> 📋 Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.

### Monitoring 

| Data Version     | Top 1 Accuracy | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model | 85%            | 95%            |
